\emph{Virtualization is a method of running multiple independent virtual operating systems
on a single physical computer. All the guest operating systems are completely isolated
It is a way of maximizing utilization of physical resources in order to minimize
investment in hardware. It also increase total productivity of the hardware. It has
been around since the first mainframe systems. This seminar mainly focuses on
virtualization as it pertains in any organization, but before considering any type of
server virtualization, it's important to define what technology or category of service
you're trying to virtualizes. Generally speaking, virtualization falls into three
categories: Operating System, Network, and Applications. All these categories
depends on one other. We can achieve scalability , reduce cost and reduce risk of
failure.}
